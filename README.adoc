= Tramotech Tool

Tramotech Tool is a Java library that provides annotations for configuring and initializing your application using external configuration files. It simplifies the process of reading configuration properties and injecting them into your classes.

== Features

* Annotate classes with `@TConfiguration` to specify the configuration file.
* Annotate fields with `@TValue` to inject configuration properties.

== Installation

To use MyLibrary in your project, you can add it as a Maven dependency.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.afikri-code</groupId>
    <artifactId>tramotool</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version> // Use the latest release version
</dependency>
----

Ensure that you have configured the GitHub repository as a Maven repository in your project's `pom.xml`.

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>github</id>
        <url>https://maven.pkg.github.com/afikri-code/tools</url>
        <releases>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </releases>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>

== Usage

Here's how you can use MyLibrary in your Java application:

[source,java,options=nowrap]
----
import annotations.ioutils.dev.ivangg.ConfigInitializer;
import annotations.ioutils.dev.ivangg.TConfiguration;
import annotations.ioutils.dev.ivangg.TValue;

@TConfiguration(filename = "myconfig.properties")
public class MyConfigClass {
    @TValue(name = "prop1")
    private String property1;

    @TValue(name = "prop2")
    private int property2;

     public MyConfigClass() {
         // Call this method to execute the annotations and initialize the configuration
         ConfigInitializer.initialize(this); // Initialize the class during construction
    }

    // ... Your class logic ...
}
----

Annotate classes with `@TConfiguration` to specify the configuration file for the class.
This annotation is used to indicate the name of the configuration file that should be
associated with the annotated class.

Annotate fields with `@TValue` to inject configuration properties.
If the `name` attribute is not provided, it defaults to the field name itself.

The `*ConfigInitializer.initialize(this)*` method needs to be called either in the constructor or in any other post-construction method of the class annotated with @TConfiguration. This is how you ensure that the annotations are processed and the configuration is initialized.
